# reactric-js

A JS framework built for developers who need a simple standalone toolkit to create full-featured web applications powered by ReactJS, KNEX.JS to give the feel of old school web development using MySQL.

Reactric JS takes the pain out of development by adding some common boilerplate code. Such as:

- UI interface builder, [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- Routing using [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
- SQL query builder for MySQL, [KNEX.JS](https://knexjs.org/)

## Get Started

You’ll need to have Node v12.6.0 or later on your local development machine. You can use nvm (macOS/Linux) or nvm-windows to easily switch Node versions between different projects.

To get Reactric JS,
### HTTPS
```sh
git clone https://github.com/mhtamun/reactric-js.git
```
### SSH
```sh
git clone git@github.com:mhtamun/reactric-js.git
```

You don’t need to install or configure tools like Webpack or Babel.
They are preconfigured so that you can focus on the code.

Just clone project, and you’re good to go.
Once the installation is done, you can open your project folder:

```sh
cd reactric-js
```

Inside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:

```sh
npm start
```

Runs the app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.<br>
You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

When you’re ready to deploy to production, create a minified bundle with simple build for production.

```sh
npm run build 
```
